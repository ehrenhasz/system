The Digital Scriptorium of Big Iron: An Exhaustive Survey of Mainframe Code, Tapes, and Data ArchivesExecutive Abstract and Archival MethodologyThe preservation of "Big Iron"—the colloquialism for the massive mainframe computers that defined the mid-20th century computing landscape—represents one of the most complex challenges in digital heritage. Unlike the preservation of consumer electronics, where media formats were standardized and widely distributed, mainframe software exists in a fragmented ecosystem of proprietary formats, specialized magnetic media, and forgotten dialects of assembly code. This report functions as a comprehensive finding aid and analytical review of the extant sources for mainframe software, including operating systems, compilers, and scientific data sets.The analysis categorizes resources into three distinct stratigraphies: Primary Repositories (institutional archives like NASA and government servers), Community Aggregators (volunteer-driven preservation projects like Bitsavers and the CBT Tape), and Emulator-Specific Distributions (packaged systems designed for turnkey operation on modern hardware). Special attention is paid to the provenance of the data—tracing the lineage from physical 9-track tapes lying in university basements to the AWS and HET disk images available for download today.The scope of this investigation encompasses the "Seven Dwarfs" of the mainframe era (IBM, Burroughs, UNIVAC, NCR, Control Data, Honeywell, RCA, and General Electric), alongside the titanic legacy of NASA’s computing initiatives. By synthesizing data from scattered FTP sites, obscure user group logs, and government technical reports, this document maps the current availability of the software that sent humanity to the moon and built the financial infrastructure of the modern world.1. The Blue Giant’s Legacy: IBM System/360, 370, and MVS ArchivesIBM’s dominance in the mainframe market created a unique archival paradox: while the hardware was ubiquitous, the software was often guarded by strict licensing. However, a watershed moment in software history—the 1960s consent decrees and the unbundling of software from hardware—placed early versions of OS/360 into the public domain. This legal nuance has allowed for a thriving ecosystem of legal, downloadable IBM mainframe operating systems.1.1 The CBT Tape Library: The "Open Source" Before Open SourceThe CBT Tape (Connecticut Bank and Trust) is arguably the single most important artifact in the history of IBM mainframe software preservation. Originating in 1975, it represents one of the earliest forms of community-driven software sharing, predating the Free Software Foundation by nearly a decade.The collection is not a static archive but a living organism, currently on version 509 (released July 2025).1 It contains hundreds of "files"—not single files in the modern sense, but partitioned datasets (PDS) containing source code, utilities, and system modifications ("mods") written by systems programmers to fix or enhance IBM's operating systems.The archive is meticulously versioned, with recent iterations maintained by Sam Golob. It serves as the primary distribution channel for the accumulated wisdom of the IBM systems programming community.2 The availability of these tapes is robust, with the official repository located at cbttape.org.31.1.1 Structure and Key FilesThe CBT Tape is organized into "Files," which are essentially distinct software packages or collections. Understanding this numbering system is crucial for navigation:File NumberDescriptionSignificanceSourceFile 001DirectoryThe master index of the tape. Available in EBCDIC compressed ZIP and ASCII formats.4File 414Printout ConversionUtilities to convert machine control printouts to ANSI standard, essential for modern viewing.4File 415RPF (Rob's Programming Facility)A TSO-based editor (Version 2.0.0) that mimics ISPF. Critical for hobbyists who cannot license the official IBM ISPF editor.4File 417RACFADMISPF dialogs to simplify RACF (Resource Access Control Facility) administration.4File 424VETAPEA utility for converting 3420 tape formats to 3480, bridging different generations of magnetic media.4File 421XACORZAPA system modification tool by Robert Budge, indicative of the low-level patching required in mainframe maintenance.4The distribution formats for these files cater to both emulators and physical hardware restoration. AWS Format is the standard for the Hercules emulator, encapsulating the variable-length records and tape marks of the original media.1 ZIP Format allows for PC-based inspection of the source code, usually EBCDIC-encoded text files.4 The archive also includes "Overflow" tapes (e.g., V466), which house older, superseded, or less frequently used utilities that are nonetheless vital for historical accuracy on older machine generations.1Insight: The longevity of the CBT Tape—spanning 50 years—demonstrates the "bazaar" model of software development existed in the enterprise sector long before Linux. It served as a critical transmission vector for knowledge, allowing isolated systems programmers to share usermods that often became de facto standards.1.2 The Public Domain Operating Systems: OS/360 and MVS 3.8jThe holy grail for mainframe hobbyists is a fully functional operating system that runs without violating IBM's intellectual property rights. The last version of MVS (Multiple Virtual Storage) released before IBM asserted copyright on the operating system code was MVS 3.8j. Consequently, this specific release forms the kernel of almost all hobbyist mainframe distributions.The availability of IBM operating systems is largely dictated by the "Copyright Wall." In 1983, IBM shifted its policy to "Object Code Only" (OCO) for operating system releases. This created a stark division in the archival landscape. Systems released prior to this decision, such as OS/360, MVS 3.8j, and DOS/360, exist in the public domain or are widely treated as abandonware safe for hobbyist use. Systems released after this date, including MVS/XA, MVS/ESA, OS/390, and z/OS, remain strictly proprietary. While MVS 3.8j lacks the extended addressing capabilities of the later XA (Extended Architecture) systems, it remains the most sophisticated IBM environment legally available for download and study.61.2.1 The Jay Moseley and Volker Bandke CollectionsJay Moseley’s archives are central to the "Turnkey" MVS community. His "MVS 3.8j Installation Instructions" (now in Version 8, May 2024) provide the canonical roadmap for building a system from scratch using IBM distribution tapes.6 These instructions guide the user through the arcane process of "System Generation" (SYSGEN), compiling the OS from source and object modules.Turnkey MVS (TK4- / TK5): These are pre-packaged distributions. Instead of mounting raw distribution tapes and performing a chaotic system generation (SYSGEN), users can download a set of DASD (Direct Access Storage Device) images.TK5 (Turnkey 5): Released in early 2025, this distribution includes significant enhancements like BREXX (a REXX implementation for 360), RAKF (a RACF-compatible security monitor), and RPF (editor).5 It reduces the DASD footprint to 15 volumes (down from 28 in TK4+), utilizing 3390 disk geometry for better efficiency.5Source: prince-webdesign.nl/tk5 and wizards-of-os.com (Volker Bandke’s legacy site).Raw Distribution Tapes: For purists, the original IBM distribution tapes for OS/360 and MVS 3.8j are hosted on Bitsavers and the Internet Archive. These appear as k360s-mb118l.aws (OS/360 v21.8) and similar filenames, preserving the exact state of the software as it was shipped by IBM in the 1970s.91.3 The Compiler Archives: Speaking the Language of 1970Operating systems are useless without compilers. The MVS 3.8j environment relies on compilers that were free at the time. The Jay Moseley archive 10 and the Bitsavers software directory 11 preserve these critical artifacts:LanguageStandard VersionDistribution ArchiveNotesCOBOLOS/VS COBOL Rel 2.45740-CB1The "Old" COBOL. Does not support modern COBOL 85 standards. 12FortranFortran IV (H)Level 21.8The optimizing compiler. "H" indicates it requires more memory to run than "G". 10PL/IPL/I (F)5.5The full language compiler. Often used for system utilities. 10ALGOLALGOL F01 JUL 67Rare, but included in the MVT 21.8f distribution. 10Archival Note: While modern IBM compilers (Enterprise COBOL) are strictly licensed, these older versions are available as tape images (AWS) on sites like jaymoseley.com and bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/360/. They are sufficient for compiling the vast majority of legacy code found on the CBT tape.2. To the Stars: NASA’s Software HeritageThe intersection of "Big Iron" and space exploration produced some of the most rigorously engineered software in human history. NASA’s archival approach has been bifurcated: deep preservation of high-profile missions (Apollo) and a broad, sometimes inaccessible, catalog of scientific codes (COSMIC).2.1 The Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) Source CodeThe preservation of the Apollo source code is a triumph of digital archaeology. The code was not merely "downloaded" but reconstructed from scans of hard-copy assembler listings (the "Luminary" and "Comanche" printouts).Primary Repository: The Virtual AGC Project (ibiblio.org/apollo) and its GitHub mirrors.13Comanche055: The Command Module software.Luminary099: The Lunar Module software (famous for the 1201/1202 alarms).Format: The code is written in yaYUL assembler. Archives include both the raw source (.agc files) and the scanned page images from the MIT Museum.14Access: Public Domain. Sourced from the MIT Instrumentation Lab archives.Insight: The availability of this code on platforms like GitHub 13 has allowed for static analysis by modern tools, revealing that despite the constraints (36K words of ROM), the code was exceptionally robust, featuring real-time task scheduling that modern OSs still emulate.2.2 COSMIC: The Lost and Found of NASA CodeThe Computer Software Management and Information Center (COSMIC) was NASA's software distribution facility at the University of Georgia. For decades, it sold tapes of NASA code to the public.Current Status: The original COSMIC facility is defunct. Its successor is the NASA Software Catalog (software.nasa.gov).15Availability:Modern Catalog: Offers "General Use" software free of charge, but often requires a "Software Usage Agreement" (SUA), restricting direct anonymous downloads.15Historical Archives: The Internet Archive hosts older snapshots of the COSMIC catalog and specific unclassified codes.16 For example, MINIVER (aerodynamic heating code) can be found in the NTRS (NASA Technical Reports Server) archives.17NTRS: This is a goldmine for documentation of the code. Reports often contain the full mathematical algorithms, and occasionally, appendices with full Fortran listings.182.3 The Space Shuttle (HAL/S)Shuttle software was written in HAL/S (High-order Assembly Language/Shuttle). Unlike Apollo, the Shuttle source code is less ubiquitous due to ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) restrictions that governed much of the shuttle's later life. However, the Internet Archive holds "Space Shuttle" CD-ROMs and simulation data 19, and technical descriptions of the HAL/S language and compiler are available on Bitsavers and NTRS.2.4 Modern NASA Data PortalsWhile this report focuses on "Big Iron" legacy code, it is important to acknowledge the modern evolution of these archives. The code.nasa.gov portal provides access to modern open-source projects, including GTM_DesignSim (Generic Transport Model).21 Additionally, the Worldview tool allows for the visualization of satellite data, providing a bridge between the raw data archives and user-friendly interaction.213. The DEC Hierarchy: PDP-10, PDP-11, and the Hacker EthosDigital Equipment Corporation (DEC) systems were the cradle of hacker culture (MIT AI Lab, Stanford SAIL). Consequently, the preservation of DEC software is driven less by corporate archives and more by passionate user groups.3.1 The Trailing-Edge ArchivesThe definitive source for DEC software is the Trailing-Edge Software Archives (trailing-edge.com). This site serves as a mirror for the massive DECUS (Digital Equipment Computer Users Society) library.PDP-10 (TOPS-10/TOPS-20): The archive contains complete distributions of the TOPS operating systems.Files: TOPS-20 V7.0 distribution tapes are available as compressed tape images.22Formats: Files are often in .TAP (SimH tape format) or .DSK (disk image).PDP-11 (RSTS/E, RSX-11): The archive holds the "RSTS-11 Archive," representing the original set of 148 DECUS library entries.233.2 The DECUS LibraryThe DECUS library was a mechanism for users to submit programs on tape to a central authority, which then redistributed them.Scope: Compilers (Pascal, C), Games (Adventure, Star Trek), and Utilities.Access: The pdp-10.trailing-edge.com site organizes these into "DECUS 10-LIB" trees. For instance, DECUS 10-LIB-1 contains submissions 10-3 through 10-138.22Visualizing the Archive: The file lists often appear as DIR files or TAP archives. The "Symposium Tapes" (e.g., Spring 1980, Chicago) are particularly rich "time capsules" of the state of the art at that specific moment.233.3 SIMH Tape FormatsThe preservation of DEC software relies on the SIMH emulator. The archive provides software in .TAP format, which encapsulates the physical characteristics of DECtape and Magtape (9-track). This format preserves the directory structures (UFDs and MFDs) used by TOPS-10.24 Tools such as simhtapetool and vtapeutils are available to manage and manipulate these virtual tape images, allowing for the creation of new tapes from simple CSV definitions.254. The Multics Repository: Ancestor of the Modern WorldMultics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) is the progenitor of Unix and, by extension, Linux. Its preservation status has shifted from proprietary obscurity to open access thanks to the efforts of Bull HN (the successor to Honeywell's computer division) and MIT.4.1 The Bull HN ContributionIn a significant act of preservation, Bull HN provided the source code for the final Multics release, MR 12.5 (November 1992), to MIT.27Repository: The canonical source is multicians.org and its associated GitHub mirrors (dancrossnyc/multics).28Completeness: The archive includes 5,877 source files.30 It is one of the few instances where a complete, "end-of-life" commercial mainframe OS source tree is available to the public.Mechanism: The source is distributed as archive files (a Multics-specific format). Modern users typically access these via the DPS8M simulator, which can mount the virtual tape images containing the source.284.2 Honeywell GCOS and the 36-bit LegacyWhile Multics captures the imagination, the GCOS (General Comprehensive Operating System) was the workhorse of the Honeywell 6000 series.Status: GCOS software is scarcer than Multics. However, Bitsavers hosts PDF documentation for GCOS III and GCOS 8.31Tape Images: Some GCOS tape images (e.g., GCOS6, Mod 400) have been recovered from "trash" finds and uploaded to bitsavers directories under /honeywell/.32 The dps8m project primarily targets Multics but maintains an interest in GCOS preservation.335. Bitsavers.org: The Alexandria of ComputingIf the CBT Tape is the repository for code, Bitsavers.org is the repository for everything else—and increasingly, the code itself. Managed by Al Kossow, this archive is the foundation of almost all mainframe restoration projects.5.1 The Archive StructureBitsavers is organized by vendor. For the "Big Iron" researcher, the key directories are:/pdf/ibm/: Documentation, Logic Manuals (PLMs), and Hardware specifications.34/bits/ibm/: Binary images. This includes the elusive APL workspaces, 1401 diagnostic tapes, and Series/1 software.35/bits/cdc/: Control Data Corporation software. This is critical because CDC software was heavily export-controlled and is rarer in the wild. The directory includes Cyber and 1700 series software.365.2 The Importance of "Program Logic Manuals" (PLMs)Bitsavers is unique in its focus on PLMs. In the IBM mainframe era, source code was not always provided, but PLMs were. These manuals contain detailed flowcharts and descriptions of the OS internals (e.g., "OS/360 FORTRAN IV H Compiler Program Logic Manual" 37).Use Case: Modern preservationists use PLMs to reverse-engineer missing source code or to debug the operation of emulated systems. They are the "Rosetta Stone" for binary tape images.6. The Scientific Supercomputers: CDC, Cray, and UnivacRecovering software for scientific supercomputers is significantly harder than for business mainframes. These machines were fewer in number, often located in secure government labs, and destroyed thoroughly upon decommissioning.6.1 Control Data Corporation (CDC)CDC machines (6600, 7600, Cyber) ran operating systems like NOS (Network Operating System) and SCOPE.Archives: Bitsavers hosts a Cyber software directory.38Specific Finds: The "Desktop Cyber" emulator project has consolidated many of these images. The "Software Engineering Services TXTCODE 2.0" is a recent addition.39Chippewa OS: The early precursor to CDC operating systems. Images are extremely rare but exist in the Bitsavers /bits/cdc/chippewa/ directory.406.2 Univac and the Exec-8 UniverseUnivac (later Sperry, then Unisys) systems ran the Exec-8 operating system.Documentation: The "1108 Exec 8 Programmer’s Reference" is available on the Internet Archive.41Source Code: The "Morse Code Exec" project provides a unique glimpse—a standalone bootable OS for the UNIVAC 1108 written by John Walker (founder of Autodesk).42Tape Images: Unlike IBM, few raw Univac distribution tapes have surfaced publicly. Most preservation relies on the Univac 1100 Series hobbyist community which circulates images privately or via the unite.org user group.436.3 RCA Spectra 70The RCA Spectra 70 series was designed to be compatible with IBM's System/360. Despite this compatibility, software specific to the Spectra 70 is scarce. The primary resources available are marketing brochures and technical manuals on the Internet Archive and Bitsavers.44 However, due to the high degree of compatibility, much of the standard IBM software (compilers, utilities) could theoretically run on Spectra hardware simulators.6.4 The Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS)The DTSS is a historic system, primarily for its introduction of the BASIC programming language.Preservation Efforts: A web-based emulator exists, developed using an original GE-235 hardware simulator and DN-30 executive emulation.45Source Code: Efforts to assemble the original source code involved manual transcription from listings, with the original "Dartmouth BASIC" compiler listings available as PDF scans.457. Government and Institutional ArchivesBeyond the vendor-specific repositories, large government archives hold significant collections of software and algorithms, often hidden within technical reports or specialized file formats.7.1 The National Archives (NARA)The National Archives maintains records of software formats to ensure long-term preservation of government data. Their "Digital Preservation" framework lists specific formats like A86 assembler source code and PE (Portable Executable) files.46 While NARA is primarily a repository of records rather than a software library, their GitHub presence (github.com/usnationalarchives) indicates a modern shift toward open-source tools for digital preservation.477.2 Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC)The DTIC is an invaluable resource for the algorithms that ran on Big Iron. Technical reports from the Cold War era often contain complete source code listings or detailed algorithmic descriptions that were unclassified.Finding: Reports on the SMART algorithm (Smooth Multiple Additive Regression Technique) include software descriptions.48Access: Many of these reports are available as PDFs with full text, allowing researchers to extract code that was never formally released on tape.498. The Archivist's Toolkit: Reading the UnreadableDownloading a "tape" is only the first step. The mainframe data format is fundamentally alien to modern byte-stream architectures.8.1 Tape Formats: AWS, HET, and E11Mainframe tapes are recorded in blocks, separated by physical gaps (Inter-Record Gaps). A simple binary copy (dd) of a tape destroys this structure.AWS (Awstape): The de facto standard for IBM mainframe emulation. It includes headers defining the block size of each record. Most downloads on cbttape.org and jaymoseley.com are in this format.1HET (Hercules Emulated Tape): A compressed format used for large datasets.TAP (SimH): Used for DEC and other non-IBM systems. It encapsulates the record structure used by controllers like the TU10 or TE16.8.2 The Role of EmulationThe "Download" is useless without the "Iron." The report identifies three critical emulation platforms that act as the players for these media files:Hercules: For IBM System/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture. It is the engine that runs the MVS 3.8j turnkey systems.5SimH: The multi-system simulator. It handles DEC (PDP-10/11), Data General (Nova), and early IBM (1401, 1620) systems.50DPS8M: The specialized simulator for Honeywell/Multics systems.519. Conclusion: The Fragility of Bit RotThe research reveals a robust but uneven landscape. IBM and DEC systems are well-preserved due to strong hobbyist communities (Hercules and SimH). NASA’s Apollo code is secure due to its historical prestige. However, vast swathes of computing history—particularly from vendors like Burroughs (B-series), RCA (Spectra), and GE—are at risk. The archives listed in this report (Bitsavers, CBT Tape, Trailing-Edge) are not merely file servers; they are the digital museums of the 21st century. For the researcher, the act of downloading these tapes is an act of preservation, ensuring that the logic that defined the 20th century remains executable in the 21st.Summary of Key RepositoriesVendorPrimary Archive URLKey ContentIBMcbttape.orgMVS Utilities, User Mods, SourceIBMbitsavers.org/bits/IBM1401, Series/1, Raw Tape ImagesDECtrailing-edge.comTOPS-10/20, RSTS/E, DECUS LibraryNASAibiblio.org/apolloApollo Guidance Computer SourceHoneywellmulticians.orgMultics Source Code (MR 12.5)CDCbitsavers.org/bits/CDCCyber NOS, Chippewa OSUnivacunite.org / Internet ArchiveExec-8 Docs, Morse Code Exec
